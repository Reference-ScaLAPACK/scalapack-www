== Presentation

*ScaLAPACK* is a library of high-performance linear algebra routines for parallel distributed memory machines.
ScaLAPACK solves dense and banded linear systems, least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.
The key ideas incorporated into ScaLAPACK include the use of

 . a *block cyclic data distribution* for dense matrices and a block data distribution for banded matrices, parametrizable at runtime; 
 . *block-partitioned algorithms* to ensure high levels of data reuse; 
 .  well-designed *low-level modular components* that simplify the task of parallelizing the high level routines by making their *source code the same as in the sequential case*.

The goals of the ScaLAPACK project are the same than the one's of LAPACK, namely:

  - *efficiency* (to run as fast as possible),
  - *scalability*  (as the problem size and number of processors grow),
  - *reliability*  (including error bounds),
  - *portability*  (across all important parallel machines),
  - *flexibility* (so users can construct new routines from well-designed parts),
  - and *ease of use* (by making the interface to LAPACK and ScaLAPACK look as similar as possible).

Many of these goals, particularly portability, are aided by developing and
promoting standards , especially for low-level communication and computation
routines. We have been successful in attaining these goals, limiting most
machine dependencies to three standard libraries called the BLAS, or Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms, LAPACK and BLACS, or Basic Linear Algebra
Communication Subprograms.  LAPACK will run on any machine where the BLAS are
available, and ScaLAPACK will run on any machine where BLAS, LAPACK and the
BLACS are available.

The library is currently written in Fortran (with the exception of a few
symmetric eigenproblem auxiliary routines written in C).  The name ScaLAPACK is
an acronym for Scalable Linear Algebra PACKage, or Scalable LAPACK.  The most
recent version of ScaLAPACK is 2.0.0, released in November 11, 2011.

=== PLASMA

The Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures (PLASMA)
project aims to address the critical and highly disruptive situation that is
facing the Linear Algebra and High Performance Computing community due to the
introduction of multi-core architectures.

PLASMA's ultimate goal is to create software frameworks that enable programmers
to simplify the process of developing applications that can achieve both high
performance and portability across a range of new architectures.

The development of programming models that enforce asynchronous, out of order
scheduling of operations is the concept used as the basis for the definition of
a scalable yet highly efficient software framework for Computational Linear
Algebra applications.

=== MAGMA

The MAGMA (Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures) project aims to
develop a dense linear algebra library similar to LAPACK but for
heterogeneous/hybrid architectures, starting with current ``Multicore+GPU''
systems.

The MAGMA research is based on the idea that, to address the complex challenges
of the emerging hybrid environments, optimal software solutions will themselves
have to hybridize, combining the strengths of different algorithms within a
single framework. Building on this idea, we aim to design linear algebra
algorithms and frameworks for hybrid manycore and GPUs systems that can enable
applications to fully exploit the power that each of the hybrid components
offers.
